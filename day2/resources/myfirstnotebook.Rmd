# My section (Big Heading 1)
This is some text. In R notebooks # can be usd to define section headings. **define words in bold**, *define italics*.

- we can also
- have bullet points

Below is a section of R code:

```{r}
print("hello world")
```

## My sub-section (Medium Heading 2)
This is some text. In R notebooks ## can be used to define sub-section headings (###, #### define sub-subheadings etc.)

We can also include plots in a notebook:

```{r}
x <- seq(1:8)
y <- x*x
plot(y~x)
```
Here we calculate the mean and display it:
```{r}
mean_x <- mean(x)
mean_x
```
